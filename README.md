# Hypothesis and Regression Testing using NYC Taxi Data

### Problem Statement:
NYC cab drivers face uncertainty regarding which payment methods lead to higher fare amounts, potentially missing opportunities to maximize their revenue. There is a need to statistically analyze the relationship between payment types and fare pricing to determine whether specific payment methods significantly impact earnings, enabling drivers to make informed decisions about payment preferences to optimize their income. Additionally, regression analysis can help identify which trip characteristics (distance, duration, passenger count) most strongly predict fare amounts, allowing drivers to understand the key factors that drive higher earnings and make strategic decisions about trip selection and routing.

### Objective
Our research aims to find whether payment methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between cash and credit card payment types and fare amount. We will employ A/B hypothesis testing to statistically examine the differences between these two payment methods and determine which generates higher fares for NYC cab drivers. Additionally, we will use regression analysis to identify which trip characteristics (distance, duration, passenger count) most strongly predict fare amounts, providing drivers with comprehensive insights into both payment method preferences and the key factors that drive higher earnings to optimize their revenue strategies.

### Hypothesis Testing: Research Question

"Which payment method (cash vs. credit card) results in higher average fare amounts for NYC cab drivers without compromising customer satisfaction?"
